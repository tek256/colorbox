### Please note the repository as it is currently is WIP, it will be done soon (on vacation currently)

### About
Colorbox is a dead simple utility for making your monitor into a color of your choice.

### Target Platforms
Here are the target platforms for this library:
```
- Windows
- Linux
- Mac OSX
- BSD
```

_NOTE: I'm always open to adding more target platforms!_

### Building
Building this application yourself requires [CMake](https://cmake.org/) to be installed. After CMake is installed you should be able to build using:
```
cmake -Bbuild -S.
cmake --build build
```
For more information of building/dependencies that might crop up, check out the [Build Guide](https://github.com/tek256/colorbox/wiki/Build-Guide).

### Todo
```
- Cleanup warnings
- Create release binaries
- Automate build/release candidate generation with GitHub Workflows
```
